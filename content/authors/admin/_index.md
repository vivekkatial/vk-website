Currently the Executive Director at the [Good Data Institute](https://www.gooddatainstitute.com/), Data Scientist at [Multitudes](https://www.multitudes.co/) and a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne School of Mathematics and Statistics. My PhD research is conducting Instance Space analysis on Quantum optimisation algorithms, under the supervision of [Prof. Kate Smith-Miles](http://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/) and [Dr Charles Hill](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/192149-charles-hill)

I am someone who loves math, coding and travel. I pride myself on making my work reproducible and thrive for best practice. I enjoy getting my hands dirty in data and am always looking for opportunities where technology can be used for social good.
