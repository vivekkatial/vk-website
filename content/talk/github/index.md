summary: Github is one of the power tools of programming. It allows you to keep track of what you did and when you did it, you can undo any changes you decide and it also collaborates at scale with other people. This tutorial will be a gentle introduction to Git and Github, a modern version control tool that is very popular with data scientists and software developers.
