## About me
I’ve been a Data Scientist since 2016 and have worked with a few tech-startups and NFPs. I’m now working at [Multitudes](https://www.multitudes.co) as a Data Scientist, a fellow at the [Good Data Institute](https://www.gooddatainstitute.com) and also a teaching assistant for Supply Chain Analytics in the Masters of Business Analytics program at [Melbourne Business School](https://mbs.edu/home). I am also in the middle of doing a **PhD** in Quantum Computing and Optimisation. Why do I do this to myself? I have no clue 

## Credits
